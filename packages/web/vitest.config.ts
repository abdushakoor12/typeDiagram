// [WEB-VITEST-CONFIG] Vitest runs the pure-logic tests (highlight, debounce,
// parser-adjacent helpers, …). UI-interaction tests (splitter, viewport,
// zoom-controls, editor-zoom, converter, playground) live under e2e/ and run
// in Playwright so they cover both desktop and mobile viewports.
// Coverage threshold enforcement is intentionally moved to
// scripts/merge-coverage.ts, which merges this summary with Playwright's.
